# Todo Application Development Plan

This plan outlines the development of a console-based Todo application in Node.js with TypeScript, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Test-Driven Development (TDD), abstracted I/O with dependency injection, a colorful console interface, JSON storage with flexibility for other formats (e.g., XML, CSV), and seamless code quality checks. Each task includes a confirmation step to ensure controlled progression.

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript for static typing.
- **Jest**: Testing framework with `@types/jest` and `ts-jest` for TypeScript support.
- **ESLint**: Linting with `@typescript-eslint` for TypeScript rules.
- **Prettier**: Auto-formatting for consistent code style.
- **Husky**: Git hooks for pre-commit linting and testing.
- **Chalk**: Colorful console output (abstracted, with `@types/chalk`).
- **Inquirer**: Interactive CLI prompts (abstracted, with `@types/inquirer`).
- **fs-extra**: File system operations (abstracted, with `@types/fs-extra`).
- **uuid**: Unique ID generation (abstracted, with `@types/uuid`).
- **nodemon** (dev dependency): Auto-restart with `ts-node` for TypeScript execution.
- **ts-node** (dev dependency): Run TypeScript files during development.

## Development Guidelines

- Always create correct branch like task instruct

## Key Considerations
- **TypeScript**: Enhances type safety and maintainability.
- **Validation Layer**: `TodoValidator` ensures Single Responsibility Principle and testability.
- **Command Dispatcher**: Improves CLI extensibility and maintainability.
- **Error Handling**: `ErrorHandler` provides consistent error reporting.
- **TDD**: Every component follows the TDD cycle (test, implement, refactor).
- **Abstraction**: `FileSystem`, `IdGenerator`, `TodoRepository`, and `ConsoleInterface` ensure flexibility.
- **Seamless Quality**: Husky, ESLint, and Prettier automate checks.
- **Storage Flexibility**: `TodoRepository` supports JSON and future formats.
- **Colorful UI**: `ConsoleInterface` with `Chalk` and `Inquirer` ensures an appealing CLI.
- **Confirmation Steps**: Each task requires confirmation to ensure controlled progression.

# Task 11: Test End-to-End Functionality (TDD)

- Write integration tests in `tests/integration` for happy paths (CRUD operations) and error scenarios (e.g., corrupted JSON, invalid input, service failures), stubbing `FileSystem`.
- Implement glue code to pass integration tests, using `ErrorHandler` for structured error reporting.
- Refactor for performance, readability, and type safety.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION BEFORE PROCEEDING TO NEXT TASK**

# üîß Additional Information

**Branch Strategy**:
- Use conventional branch naming:
  - `feat/` - new features (e.g., `feat/domain-layer`)
  - `docs/` - documentation updates (e.g., `docs/readme-update`)
  - `test/` - test-related changes (e.g., `test/integration-tests`)
  - `fix/` - bug fixes (e.g., `fix/validation-error`)
  - `refactor/` - code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/repository-pattern`)
  - `chore/` - maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/ci-setup`)

**Commit Strategy**:
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):
  - Example: `feat: add TodoItem model with validation`
  - Example: `test: add unit tests for repository layer`

**Task Execution**:
- **‚ö†Ô∏è WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION BEFORE PROCEEDING TO NEXT TASK** (after each major task)
- Always follow TDD strategy. (Test, Code, Refactor)!
- Run relevant tests after completing each subtask to ensure stability
